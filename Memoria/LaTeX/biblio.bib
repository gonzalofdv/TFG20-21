abstract = {Crypto ransomware encrypts user files and then extorts a ransom for decryption, thus it brings a big threat to users. To address this problem, we propose RansomSpector, an introspection-based approach to detect crypto ransomware. Compared to previous solutions, our approach makes progress in two aspects. First, RansomSpector is based on the virtual machine introspection technique, and it resides in the hypervisor layer under the operating system (OS) where ransomware runs. Thus it is capable of analyzing OS-level ransomware and difficult to be bypassed by privilege escalation attacks. Second, RansomSpector monitors both the filesystem and network activities for ransomware detection, thus it achieves a higher precision and earlier warning than the approaches that only leverage the filesystem activities as the detecting basis. To validate our approach, we have implemented a prototype of RansomSpector, and collected 2,117 recent ransomware samples to evaluate it. The evaluation results indicate that our system effectively detects ransomware with a low performance overhead ( < 5\% on average).}

This booming in technology is bringing ease in our lifestyle and making formerly impossible things possible. Internet of things playing a vital role in bridging this gap easily and rapidly. IoT is changing our lifestyle and the way of working the technologies, by bringing them together at the one page in several application areas of daily life. However, IoT has to face several challenges in the form of cyber scams, one of the major challenges IoT has to face is the likelihood of Ransomware attack. Ransomware is a malicious kind of software that restricts access to vital information in some way and demand payment for getting access to this information. The ransomware attack is becoming widespread daily, and it is bringing disastrous consequences, including loss of sensitive data, loss of productivity, data destruction, and loss of reputation and business downtime. Which further leads to millions of dollar daily losses due to the downtime. This is inevitable for organizations to revise their annual cybersecurity goals and need to implement proper resilience and recovery plan to keep business running. However, before proceeding towards providing a practical solution, there is a need to synthesize the existing data and statistics about this crucial attack to make aware to the researchers and practitioners. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on evolution, prevention and mitigation of Ransomware in IoT context. This paper differs from existing in various dimensions: firstly, it provides deeper insights about Ransomware evolution in IoT. Secondly; it discusses diverse aspects of Ransomware attacks on IoT which include, various types of Ransomware, Current research in Ransomware, Existing techniques to prevent and mitigate Ransomware attacks in IoT along with the ways to deal with an affected machine, the decision about paying the ransom or not, and future emerging trends of Ransomware propagation in IoT. Thirdly, a summary of current research is also provided to show various directions of research. In sum, this detailed survey is expected to be useful for researchers and practitioners who are involved in developing solutions for IoT security.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic was a remarkable, unprecedented event which altered the lives of billions of citizens globally resulting in what became commonly referred to as the new-normal in terms of societal norms and the way we live and work. Aside from the extraordinary impact on society and business as a whole, the pandemic generated a set of unique cyber-crime related circumstances which also affected society and business. The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, three or four unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged salient events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and execute cyber-crime campaigns.}

Current ransomware detection techniques usually build a complex model that incorporates various behavioral traits. The traits include suspicious file activities, API call pattern or frequency, registry keys, file extensions, etc. In this paper, we build a two-stage mixed ransomware detection model, Markov model and Random Forest model. First we focus on Windows API call sequence pattern and build a Markov model to capture the characteristics of ransomware. Next we build Random Forest machine learning model to the remaining data in order to control both false positive (FPR) and false negative (FNR) error rates. As a result of our two-stage mixed detection method we can achieve overall accuracy 97.3\% with 4.8\% FPR and 1.5\% FNR.}

Exploitation of these networks via the introduction of undetected malware ultimately degrades their competitive edge, while taking advantage of limited network visibility and the high cost of analyzing massive numbers of programs. This article introduces the novel Malware Target Recognition (MaTR) system which combines the decision tree machine learning algorithm with static heuristic features for malware detection. By focusing on contextually important static heuristic features, this research demonstrates superior detection results. Experimental results on large sample datasets demonstrate near ideal malware detection performance (99.9+% accuracy) with low false positive (8.73e-4) and false negative rates (8.03e-4) at the same point on the performance curve. Test results against a set of publicly unknown malware, including potential advanced competitor tools, show MaTR’s superior detection rate (99%) versus the union of detections from three commercial antivirus products (60%). The resulting model is a fine granularity sensor with potential to dramatically augment cyberspace situation awareness.}

abstract = {Ransomware attacks are one of the biggest and attractive threats in cyber security today. Anti-virus software’s are often inefficient against zero-day malware and ransomware attacks, important network infections could result in a large amount of data loss. Such attacks are also becoming more dynamic and able to change their signatures – hence creating an arms race situation. This study investigates the relationship between a process behavior and its nature, in order to determine whether it is ransomware or not. The paper aim is to see if using this method will help the evading malicious software’s and use as a self-defense mechanism using machine learning that emulates the human immune system. The analysis was conducted on 7 ransomware, 41 benign software, and 34 malware samples. The results show that we are able to distinguish between ransomware and benign applications, with a low false-positive and false-negative rate.}

The recent resurgence of high-profile ransomware attacks, particularly in critical sectors such as the health care industry, has highlighted the pressing need for effective defenses. While users are always advised to have a reliable backup strategy, the growing number of paying victims in recent years suggests that an endpoint defense that is able to stop and recover from ransomware's destructive behavior is needed.",

abstract = {Run-time monitoring of program execution behavior is widely used to discriminate between benign and malicious processes running on an end-host. Towards this end, most of the existing run-time intrusion or malware detection techniques utilize information available in Windows Application Programming Interface (API) call arguments or sequences. In comparison, the key novelty of our proposed tool is the use of statistical features which are extracted from both spatial arguments) and temporal (sequences) information available in Windows API calls. We provide this composite feature set as an input to standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The results of our experiments show that the concurrent analysis of spatio-temporal features improves the detection accuracy of all classifiers. We also perform the scalability analysis to identify a minimal subset of API categories to be monitored whilst maintaining high detection accuracy.},

Smaller companies are using, producing and storing larger amounts of data, making the potential gains from a successful hack or security breach involving a small organisation far higher than they were five years ago. Smaller companies are using, producing and storing larger amounts of data, making the potential gains from a successful hack or security breach far higher than they were five years ago. The reality for SMEs is that they must deal with a similar level of risk to their larger enterprise counterparts, but with lower budgets and limited resources.
